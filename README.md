# Java Connect4 AI agent
 Agent made for Connect4 game in Java

It was a university project, where my task was the implementation of the StudentPlayer class, while the rest were given.

The agent uses minimax algorithm with pruning and a search depth of 6. It can beat a greedy agent or an agent using minimax with lower depth search value.

By starting the program, you can try to play against it on a simple console.
